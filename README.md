Introducing a game-changing datapack for vanilla Minecraft building, designed to elevate your building experience with vertical slabs. Explore the seamless functionality in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes.

## How does it work?

1. **Crafting the Tool:**
   Obtain a carrot on a stick

2. **Initiating Transformation:**
   Right-click on any slab of your choice to seamlessly convert it into a vertical slab.

3. **Rotation Adjustment:**
   For precise customization, perform additional right-clicks to change the rotation of the vertical slab according to your design preferences.

4. **Deletion Feature:**
   Ensure control over your creations by utilizing a shift-right-click to efficiently delete the vertical slabs when needed.
